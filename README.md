## Description

Earbeats is a static single-page website that transforms the way users explore and shop for audio products. Unlike traditional marketplaces that offer only static images of products, Earbeats employs the power of Three.js to provide an immersive 3D experience.

**Key Features:**

- **3D Product Showcase**: Immerse yourself in a lifelike 3D representation of audio products. Rotate, zoom, and interact with the product as if you were holding it in your hands.

- **Full-Screen Mode**: Take your exploration to the next level with a full-screen mode that allows for a closer examination of product details.

This project transcends conventional online shopping, enhancing the user experience and empowering customers to make more confident purchasing decisions. Say goodbye to flat images and hello to a new dimension in audio product exploration.
